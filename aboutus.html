    <center><p><b>The Pizza Hut story begins in May 1958. Dan and Frank Carney opened their
            550-square foot pizza restaurant in Wichita, Kansas. Dan and Frank, with friends Richard Beemer and John
            Bender, made the pizza themselves. Frank rolled the dough with a rolling pin. Richard tossed the dough in
            the air from the pie tin. Dan filled the unbaked crust with sauce. John flipped the pie from the tin during
            the baking process. Dan Carney recalled, "The people were enchanted with the product, watching us tossing
            the dough over our heads. They were really enjoying themselves"</b></p>

           <p><b> The Carneys created an innovative, high quality, engaging, informal eating experience in a friendly
            neighborhood restaurant. Pizza Hut became a popular place with the teenage and college crowd. Pizza Hut
            attracted families that enjoyed a night out eating a meal that they would not be having at home. After the
            families left, Pizza Hut transformed itself into a hangout for college-age kids. Having a good time was an
            essential part of Pizza Hut. The idea caught on. A second Pizza Hut opened in December 1958 in downtown
            Wichita. By 1963, there were forty-two Pizza Hut restaurants.</b></p>

        <p><b>The first Pizza Hut Restaurant in Pakistan was opened in December 1993 and took the culinary scene by
            surprise. From that time onwards, the brand has contributed heavily towards the development of society as a
            whole. It is responsible for creating job opportunities for the youth of the country both directly as well
            as indirectly. Furthermore, Pizza Hut during the core of its existence has gradually aided in the
            development of various local suppliers who as a requirement have to supply food staff equivalent in quality
            to the international food standards. In this regard, our restaurant chain has proved to be a major
            contributor towards the progress of the Pakistani food industry as a whole by bringing it to a point where
            they can now look forward to supplying their items to other chains as well as the international market.</b></p>

            <p> <b>Pizza Hut, being the first International franchise to enter the Pakistani market has set new standards of
            dine-in restaurants and quick delivery of oven-hot pizzas and has since then enjoyed tremendous brand
            loyalty from its customers.</b></p>
